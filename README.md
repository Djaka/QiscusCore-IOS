# qiscuscore-ios

#### CocoaPods Installation

The recommended path for installation is [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). CocoaPods provides a simple, versioned dependency management system that automates the tedious and error prone aspects of manually configuring libraries and frameworks. You can add QiscusCore to your project via CocoaPods by doing the following:

```sh
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Now create a `Podfile` in the root of your project directory and add the following:

```ruby
pod 'QiscusCore'
```

Complete the installation by executing:

```sh
$ pod install
```
